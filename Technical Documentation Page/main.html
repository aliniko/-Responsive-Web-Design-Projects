                    HTML is not a programming language; it is a markup language that
                    defines t he structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of
                    elements, which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the
                    content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The
                    enclosing tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else,
                    can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on.
                    For example, take the following line of content: HTML is not a
                    programming language; it is a markup language that defines t he
                    structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements,
                    which you use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to
                    make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing
                    tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, can
                    italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For
                    example, take the following line of content
                    <br /><br />
                    <code class="code">
                    My cate is very grumpy
                </code>
                    <br /><br />
                    If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it
                    is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:
                    <br /><br />
                    <code class="code">

                    <span>&lt;</span>p</span>
                    <span>&gt;</span>
                    My cat is very grumpy

                    <span><span>&lt;/</span>p</span>
                    <span>&gt;</span>
                </code>
                    <br><br>
                </p>

                <p>
                    The main parts of our element are as follows:
                    <br><br>

                <ol>
                    <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening
                        and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts
                        to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.</li>
                    <li>The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash
                        before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph
                        ends. Failing to add a closing tag
                        is one of the standard beginner errors
                        and can lead to strange results.</li>

                    <li>The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.</li>
                    <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag and the content together comprise the element.
                    </li>

                </ol>

                <p>You can put elements inside other elements too — this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that
                    our cat is very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" in a
                    <br>
                    <code class="code">
                        <span>&lt;</span>strong</span>
                        <span>&gt;</span>
                    </code>
                    element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized:
                </p>
                <br><br>
                <code class="code">
                    <span>&lt;</span>p</span>
                    <span>&gt;</span>
                    My cat is
                    <span>&lt;</span>strong</span>
                    <span>&gt;</span>
                    very
                    <span>&lt;</span>/strong</span>
                    <span>&gt;</span>
                    grumpy.
                    <span>&lt;</span>/p</span>
                    <span>&gt;</span>
                </code>
                <br><br>

                <p>
                    The elements have to open and close correctly so that they are clearly inside or outside one
                    another. If they overlap as shown above, then your web browser will try to make the best guess
                    at what you were trying to say, which can lead to unexpected results. So don't do it!

                <p>That wraps up the basics of individual HTML elements, but they aren't handy on their own. Now we'll
                    look at how individual elements are combined to form an entire HTML page. Let's revisit the code we
                    put into our index.html example
                    (which we first met in the Dealing with files article):

                </p>
                <br><br>

                <p>
                    Here We have the following:
                    <br> <br>

                <ul>
                    <li>the doctype. It is required preamble. In the mists of time, when HTML was young (around
                        1991/92), doctypes were meant to act as links to a set of rules that the HTML page had to
                        follow
                        to be considered good HTML, which could mean automatic error checking and other useful
                        things.
                        However these days, they don't do much, and are basically just needed to make
                        sure your document behaves correctly. That's all you need to know for now.</li>
                    <li>This "html" element wraps all the
                        content on the entire page and is sometimes known as the root element.</li>
                    <li>
                        This "Head" element acts as a container for all the stuff you want to include on the HTML
                        page
                        that isn't the content you are showing to your page's viewers. This includes things like
                        keywords and a page description that you want to appear in
                        search results, CSS to style our content, character set declarations and more.
                    </li>

                    <li>This "Meta" element sets the character set your document should use to UTF-8 which includes
                        most
                        characters from the vast majority of written languages. Essentially, it can now handle any
                        textual content you might put on it.
                        There is no reason not to set this and it can help avoid some problems later on.</li>

                    <li> This "Title" element sets the title of your page, which is the title that appears in the
                        browser tab the page is loaded in.
                        It is also used to describe the page when you bookmark/favourite it.</li>

                    <li>This "Body" element This contains all the content that you want to show to web users when
                        they
                        visit your page, whether that's text, images, videos, games, playable audio tracks or
                        whatever
                        else.</li>

                    As we said before, it embeds an image into our page in the position it appears. It does this via the
                    src (source) attribute, which contains the path to our image file.

                    We have also included an alt (alternative) attribute. In this attribute, you specify descriptive
                    text for users who cannot see the image, possibly because of the following reasons:

                    They are visually impaired. Users with significant visual impairments often use tools called screen
                    readers to read out the alt text to them.
                    Something has gone wrong causing the image not to display. For example, try deliberately changing
                    the path inside your src attribute to make it incorrect. If you save and reload the page, you should
                    see something like this in place of the image:

                </p>
                <p>

                    The keywords for alt text are "descriptive text". The alt text you write should provide the reader
                    with enough information to have a good idea of what the image conveys. In this example, our current
                    text of "My test image" is no good at all. A much better alternative for
                    our Firefox logo would be "The Firefox logo: a flaming fox surrounding the Earth."

                <h1>Headings</h1>
                <br>
                Heading elements allow you to specify that certain parts of your content are headings — or
                subheadings.
                In the same way that a book has the main title, chapter titles and subtitles, an HTML document can
                too.
                HTML contains 6 heading levels, "h1–h6", although you'll commonly only use 3 to 4 at most:
                <br><br>

                <code
                    class="code"><span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>My main
                        title<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
                        <span><span><span>&lt;</span>h2</span><span>&gt;</span></span>My top level
                        heading<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h2</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
                        <span><span><span>&lt;</span>h3</span><span>&gt;</span></span>My
                        subheading<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h3</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
                        <span><span><span>&lt;</span>h4</span><span>&gt;</span></span>My sub-subheading<span><span><span
                                    class="token punctuation">&lt;/</span>h4</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span><span></span><span></span><span></span><span></span></span></code>
                <br><br>
                </p>
                <p>

                    <strong>Note:</strong> You'll see that your heading level 1 has an implicit style. Don't use heading
                    elements to make text bigger or bold, because they are used for accessibility and other reasons such
                    as SEO. Try to create a
                    meaningful sequence of headings on your pages, without skipping levels.
